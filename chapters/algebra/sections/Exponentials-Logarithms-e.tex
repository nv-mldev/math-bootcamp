  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our skin (and other areas like the mouth, nose, and intestines) hosts hundreds of thousands of microscopic organisms.
    \item In fact, bacterial cells in our body outnumber our own cells.
    \item While some bacteria can cause illness, many are essential for our health.
    \item Bacteria reproduce through binary fission—each cell splits into two.
    \item Under ideal conditions, a single bacterium doubling every hour can lead to over 1,000 cells in 10 hours and more than 16 million in 24 hours.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item India is the second most populous country, with about 1.39 billion people in 2021.
    \item Its population grows at an annual rate of roughly 1.2\%.
    \item If this trend continues, India's population is projected to exceed China’s by 2027.

\begin{frame}{Defining Exponential Growth}
  \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Percentage Change:} 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item refers to a change based on a percent of the original amount
      \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Exponential Growth:} 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item refers to an increase based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments of time, that is, a percent increase of the original amount over time.
          \item For example, if a quantity doubles each period, that is a 100\% increase per period.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Linear Growth:} 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The original value increases by a fixed \textbf{amount} (additive rate) over equal time intervals.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exponent Decay:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item refers to a decrease based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments of time, that is, a percent decrease of the original amount over time.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Exponential Function and Its Behavior}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Suppose \(b>0\) with \(b\neq 1\). Then the \emph{exponential function} with base \(b\) is defined by
    \[
      f(x)=b^x.
    \]
    For example, if \(b=2\), then \(f(x)=2^x\). (Note that \(2^x\) is different from \(x^2\).)
  \end{block}
  \vspace{0.5em}
  \begin{block}{Behavior (for \(b>1\))}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Domain:} All real numbers, \(\mathbb{R}\).
      \item \textbf{Range:} All positive numbers, \((0,\infty)\).
      \item \(f(x)=b^x\) is an \emph{increasing} function.
      \item \(b^x\) becomes very large as \(x\) increases.
      \item \(b^x\) approaches \(0\) as \(x\) becomes very negative.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

      1 & 2 & 2 \\
      2 & 4 & 4 \\
      3 & 8 & 6 \\
      4 & 16 & 8 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Exponential vs. Linear Growth.}
  \end{table}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Linear growth (e.g., \(g(x)=2x\)) increases by a constant amount (2) for each increase in \(x\), that is, it is adding or subtracting a constant value. A constant amount \( \rightarrow \) linear growth or additive growth.
    \item Exponential growth (e.g., \(f(x)=2^x\)) increases by a constant factor (2) for each increase in \(x\), that is, it is multiplying or dividing by a constant value. A constant factor \( \rightarrow \) exponential growth or multiplicative growth.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Inverse Relationship:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \(\log_b x\) is the inverse of \(b^x\).
          \item Flipping the graph of \(b^x\) across the line \(y=x\) yields the graph of \(\log_b x\).

      \item \textbf{Monotonicity:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item For \(b>1\), \(b^x\) is increasing, so \(\log_b x\) is also increasing.

  \begin{block}{A story}
A mathematician in ancient India invented the game of chess. Filled with gratitude for the remarkable entertainment of this game, the king offered themathematician anything he wanted. The king expected the mathematician to
ask for rare jewels or a majestic palace.
But the mathematician asked only that he be given one grain of rice for the
first square on a chessboard, plus two grains of rice for the next square, plus
four grains for the next square, and so on, doubling the amount for each square,
until the 64th square on an 8-by-8 chessboard had been reached. The king was
pleasantly surprised that the mathematician had asked for such a modest reward.
A bag of rice was opened, and first 1 grain was set aside, then 2, then 4, then 8,
and so on. As the eighth square  was
reached, 128 grains of rice were counted out. The king was secretly delighted
to be paying such a small reward and also wondering at the foolishness of the
mathematician.

  \begin{frame}
    \begin{block}{Story Cont..}
      As the 16th square was reached, 32,768 grains of rice were counted out—this
was a small part of a bag of rice. But the 21st square required a full bag of rice,
and the 24th square required eight bags of rice. This was more than the king had
expected. However, it was a trivial amount because the royal granary contained
about 200,000 bags of rice to feed the kingdom during the coming winter.
As the 31st square was reached, over a thousand bags of rice were required
and were delivered from the royal granary. Now the king was worried. By the
37th square, the royal granary was two-thirds empty. The 38th square would have
required more bags of rice than were left. The king then stopped the process
and ordered that the mathematician's head be chopped off as a warning about
the greed induced by exponential growth

      area\((\frac{1}{x},1,c^{t}) = t*\text{area}(\frac{1}{x},1,c) \)

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The formula resembles the bhaviour of logarithms.
    \item Thus, area uner the curve \(y = \frac{1}{x}\) is connected with a logarithm
  \end{itemize}
  \[\text{area}(\frac{1}{x},1,e) = 1 \]
\[\text{area}(\frac{1}{x},1,e^{t}) = t \]

Assume \(t = \log_e c\) (the natural logarithm of \(c\)). Then we have
\[\text{area}(\frac{1}{x},1,c) = \text{area}(\frac{1}{x},1,e^{\log_e c}) = \log_e c\]
