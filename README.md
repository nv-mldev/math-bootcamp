# Math Bootcamp Folder Structure

This document outlines the folder structure of the Math Bootcamp project.

## Root Directory

*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
*   `requirements.txt`: Contains the Python dependencies for this project.
*   `trignometry.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for trigonometry-related work.
*   `chapters/`: Contains the main content of the bootcamp, organized by topic.
*   `figures/`: Contains figures and images used throughout the bootcamp.
*   `venv/`: Contains the Python virtual environment.

## Chapters

The `chapters` directory is organized as follows:

### Calculus

*   `chapters/calculus/introduction/`: Introduction to Calculus.
    *   `codes/`: Python code examples.
    *   `figures/`: Figures for the introduction to calculus.
    *   `latex/`: LaTeX source files.

### Geometry

*   `chapters/geometry/`: Geometry chapter.
    *   `codes/`: Code examples for geometry.
    *   `pics/`: Pictures and figures for geometry.
    *   `sections/`: Sections of the geometry chapter in LaTeX and Markdown.

### Pre-Calculus

*   `chapters/pre-calculus/chapters/`: Chapters for the Pre-Calculus section.
    *   `exponentials-logarithms/`: Chapter on exponentials and logarithms.
    *   `functions/`: Chapter on functions.
    *   `introduction/`: Introduction to Pre-Calculus.
    *   `polar-complex/`: Chapter on polar coordinates, vectors, and complex numbers.
    *   `polynomials/`: Chapter on polynomials.
    *   `real-numbers/`: Chapter on real numbers.
    *   `sequence-series/`: Chapter on sequences and series.
    *   `trignometry/`: Chapter on trigonometry.
