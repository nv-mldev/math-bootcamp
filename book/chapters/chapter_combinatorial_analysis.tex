\section{Why combinatorial analysis?}

A communication system consist of n seemingly identical antennas that are lined up in a linear ordered array. Each antenna can be either ON or OFF. The system is said to be in a good state if no two adjacent antennas are ON. How many good states are possible for a system with n antennas?
